### This quarter I will be learning how to program using R!
#### I have never worked with R before and I expect it to be challenging.

This is *efrahler*'s first assignment for **Geog458**. OUr course page can be accessed [here](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1269928).

This is the Pythagorean theorem: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$

##Rudimentary R

####Basic Arithmetic
```{r}
100 / 10 + 2
100 / (10 + 2)
5 + 8 * 40 / 11
140 / 5 + (2^4 - 20)
1000 - 6 * (7^2)
```
#### Algebra
```{r}
x <- 8 * 3 # Creates a variable called 'x'
x
x + 10
y <- 30
z <- 200
(z + 20) / 11 - y + x / 2
y^2 - x + z * x
y + 2 * x - 100 - z
```
#### Base R Functions
```{r}
seq_var <- seq(1, 30) # Variable stores sequence as a vector of integers
cities <- c("Seattle", "London", "Prague") # Character vector stores a sequence of strings
length(seq_var)
length(cities)
sum(seq_var) # Returns the sum of each item in the variable
```
#### Vectors
```{r}
one_through_five <- seq(1, 5) # Creates a new variable that stores a sequence of numbers
one_through_five
six_through_ten <- seq(6, 10)
six_through_ten
one_through_five + six_through_ten
product <- one_through_five * six_through_ten # Creates a new variable from multiplying the two vectors
product
```
####Scaling Vectors
```{r}
one_through_ten <- c(one_through_five, six_through_ten) # Combines two vectors into a new variable
one_through_ten
sum(one_through_ten) # Returns the sum of the new variable
rows <- rbind(one_through_five, six_through_ten, product) # Creates a matrix with different vectors as the rows
rows
numbers.df <- as.data.frame(rows) # Converts the matrix into a data frame
numbers.df
```
